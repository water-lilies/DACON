| random_strength                | float                 | The amount of randomness to use for scoring splits when the tree structure is selected. Use this parameter to avoid overfitting the model.The value of this parameter is used when selecting splits. On every iteration each possible split gets a score (for example, the score indicates how much adding this split will improve the loss function for the training dataset). The split with the highest score is selected.The scores have no randomness. A normally distributed random variable is added to the score of the feature. It has a zero mean and a variance that decreases during the training. The value of this parameter is the multiplier of the variance.Note.This parameter is not supported for the following loss functions:QueryCrossEntropyYetiRankPairwisePairLogitPairwise | 1                                                            | CPU                                                          |

False otherwise. | CPU and GPU                                                  |
| best_model_min_trees           | int                   | The minimal number of trees that the best model should have. If set, the output model contains at least the given number of trees even if the best model is located within these trees.Should be used with the use_best_model parameter. | None (The minimal number of trees for the best model is not set) | CPU and GPU                                                  |
| depth*Alias:* max_depth        | int                   | Depth of the tree.The range of supported values depends on the processing unit type and the type of the selected loss function:CPU — Any integer up to 16.GPU — Any integer up to 8 pairwise modes (YetiRank, PairLogitPairwise and QueryCrossEntropy) and up to  16 for all other loss functions. | 6 (16 if the growing policy is set to Lossguide)             | CPU and GPU                                                  |
| grow_policy                    | string                | The tree growing policy. Defines how to perform greedy tree construction.Possible values:SymmetricTree —A tree is built level by level until the specified depth is reached. On each iteration, all leaves from the last tree level are split with the same condition. The resulting tree structure is always symmetric.Depthwise — A tree is built level by level until the specified depth is reached. On each iteration, all non-terminal leaves from the last tree level are split. Each leaf is split by condition with the best loss improvement.Note. Models with this growing policy can not be analyzed using the PredictionDiff feature importance and can be exported only to json and cbm.Lossguide — A tree is built leaf by leaf until the specified maximum number of leaves is reached. On each iteration, non-terminal leaf with the best loss improvement is split.Note. Models with this growing policy can not be analyzed using the PredictionDiff feature importance and can be exported only to json and cbm. | SymmetricTree                                                | CPU and GPU                                                  |
| min_data_in_leaf               | int                   | The minimum number of training samples in a leaf. CatBoost does not search for new splits in leaves with samples count less than the specified value.Can be used only with the Lossguide and Depthwise growing policies. | 1                                                            | CPU and GPU                                                  |
| max_leaves                     | int                   | The maximum number of leafs in the resulting tree. Can be used only with the Lossguide growing policy.Tip. It is not recommended to use values greater than 64, since it can significantly slow down the training process. | 31                                                           | CPU and GPU                                                  |
| ignored_features               | list                  | Feature indices or names to exclude from the training. It is assumed that all passed values are feature names if at least one of the passed values can not be converted to a number or a range of numbers. Otherwise, it is assumed that all passed values are feature indices.Specifics:Non-negative indices that do not match any features are successfully ignored. For example, if five features are defined for the objects in the dataset and this parameter is set to “42”, the corresponding non-existing feature is successfully ignored.The identifier corresponds to the feature's index. Feature indices used in train and feature importance are numbered from 0 to featureCount – 1. If a file is used as [input data](https://catboost.ai/docs/concepts/input-data.html#input-data) then any non-feature column types are ignored when calculating these indices. For example, each row in the input file contains data in the following order: `cat feature<\t>label value<\t>num feature`. So for the row `rock<\t>0<\t>42`, the identifier for the “rock” feature is 0, and for the “42” feature it's 1.The addition of a non-existing feature name raises an error.For example, use the following construction if features indexed 1, 2, 7, 42, 43, 44, 45, should be ignored:`[1,2,7,42,43,44,45]` | None                                                         | CPU and GPU                                                  |

It is guaranteed that a split that separates missing values from all other values is considered when selecting trees.“Max” — Missing values are processed as the maximum value (greater than all other values) for the feature. It is guaranteed that a split that separates missing values from all other values is considered when selecting trees.Using the Min or Max value of this parameter guarantees that a split between missing values and other values is considered when selecting a new split in the tree.Note.The method for processing missing values can be set individually for each feature in the [Custom quantization borders and missing value modes](https://catboost.ai/docs/concepts/input-data_custom-borders.html) input file.

| leaf_estimation_backtracking   | string                | When the value of the leaf_estimation_iterations parameter is greater than 1, CatBoost makes several gradient or newton steps when calculating the resulting leaf values of a tree.The behaviour differs depending on the value of this parameter:No — Every next step is a regular gradient or newton step: the gradient step is calculated and added to the leaf.Any other value —Backtracking is used.In this case, before adding a step, a condition is checked. If the condition is not met, then the step size is reduced (divided by 2), otherwise the step is added to the leaf.When leaf_estimation_iterations is set to n, the leaf estimation iterations are calculated as follows: each iteration is either an addition of the next step to the leaf value, or it's a scaling of the leaf value. Scaling counts as a separate iteration. Thus, it is possible that instead of having n gradient steps, the algorithm makes a single gradient step that is reduced n times, which means that it is divided by ![img](https://yastatic.net/doccenter/images/tech2.yandex.com/en/catboost/doc/freeze/BsI2tOknXCdD9qyB-aCgYBnTSV8.svg) times.Possible values:No — Do not use backtracking. Supported on CPU and GPU.AnyImprovement — Reduce the descent step up to the point when the loss function value is smaller than it was on the previous step.
